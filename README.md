#### Preparations :
Before you can start installing Mailcow, you need to do some preparations, which mainly affect the DNS settings of the domain that you want to use to receive and send e-mails. To do this, follow the steps below:

    The hostname of your server should be "mail", so the FQDN should be "mail.testdomain.com".
    
    Add an A record for the subdomain "mail" (mail.testdomain.com) and let this point to the IP address of the mail server.
    
    Add an MX record for your domain and set the value to the mail subdomain you just created (mail.testdomain.com) with priority 10.
    
    Define a CNAME record for the subdomains "autodiscover" as well as "autoconfig" and set the destination of both CNAME records to the mail subdomain as well (mail.testdomain.com).
    
    Add an TXT record for your domain and set the value to "v=spf1 mx ~all", to allow the server specified in the MX record (the mail server where Mailcow will be installed) to send e-mails with your domain as the sender domain. The "~all" means that other servers are not allowed to send e-mails from your domain, but these e-mails will still be delivered (softfail).
    
    Define a PTR record (Reverse DNS) for the IP address of your server and set the value to the FQDN of your server ("mail.testdomain.com"). You can set this PTR record directly in the web interface of any good hoster like Contabo. For some providers, you have to write an e-mail or open a support ticket.
